#Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron
#
Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
indicating with different fields when th task will be run
and what command to run for the tasks

To define the time you can provide concrete values for minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month( mon), and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').

Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system daemon's notion of the time and timezones.

Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).

For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts at 5 a.m every week with: 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/

<pre>
    man crontab: to check manual of crontab.
    crontab -l: to check set crontab.
    crontab -e: to edit crontab.
    crontab -r: to delete user's crontab
    crontab -i: to prompt before deleting user's crontab.
</pre>

Syntax: m h dom mon dow command
sudo crontab -e -u thor
16 * * * * /usr/sbin/reboot #for timezones
