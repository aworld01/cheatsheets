Some terminologies of Machine Learning
======================================
x = inputs
w = weights
b = bias
y^ = outputs / predicted value
y = real value

y - y^ = loss
optimization = Backpropagation
cost function = loss function



numpy_vs_pyTorch
================
TRANSPOSE
=========
import torch
import numpy as np

torch.t(m) #only for 2D matrix
torch.transpose(m,0,1) #for nd matrix
np.transpos(m)




Type of Neural Networks
=======================
ANN
CNN
RNN




from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=2)

x_train
x_test
