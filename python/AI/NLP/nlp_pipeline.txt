Text preprocessing:
    Text cleanup

    Basic text preprocessing:
        sentence tokenization
        word tokenization
        lowerCasing

        Optional:
            stemming
            lematization
            removing punctuations
            removing stopWords
            language detection

    Advance preprocessing:
        POS tagging (Parts Of Speech) it can perform without removing stopWords.
        parsing
        co-refrence resolutions


Feature engineering / Word embedding:
    Using Count / Frequency:
        OHE (One Hot Encoding)
        BOW (Bag Of Words)
        TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

    Using Deep learning trained model:
        word2vector:
            CBOW (Continuous Bag Of Words)
            Skip Gram
