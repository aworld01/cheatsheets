# # Set is an unordered collection of elements much like a set in mathematics.
# # A set does not accept duplicate elements.
# # Set is mutable so we can modify it.
# # Sets are unordered so we can't access its element using index.
# # Sets are represented using curly brackets. {}
# # Elements can be of defferent types except mutable element, like List, Set or Dictionary.
# # We can create an empty set using set() function.

# # Create an empty set.
# a = set()
# print(a, type(a))

# # Create a set with elements.
# a = {10,20,'ArtificialWorld'}
# print(a, type(a))
