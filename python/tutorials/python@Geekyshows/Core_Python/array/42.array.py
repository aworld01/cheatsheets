"""
In Python, Array is an object that provide a mechanism for storing several data items with only one identifier, thereby simplifying the task of data management.
Array is beneficial if you need to store group of elements of same datatype.
Example:- Group of students, Group of Employees, Group of Dogs ((Group of Integer-10,20,30,40), (Group of Float-10.2, 20.44, 50.42)) etc.

REMEMBER
Array can story only one type of data.
In Python, The size of array is not fixed. It can increase or decrease its size dynamically.
Array and List are not same.
Array uses less memory than List.

Type of Array
There are two types of Array in Python.
One Dimensional Array / One-D Array: Single Row Multiple Columns
Example:- Student's Roll Number [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]

Multi_Dimensional Array / Multi-D Array: Multiple Rows Multiple Columns
Example:- Student's Subject Marks [40, 60, 70, 80, 30],
                                  [50, 40, 60, 30, 40]

Note:- Python doesn't support Multi-Dimensional Array but we can create Multi-Dimensional Array using third party packages like numpy.
