Package are a way of structuring python's module namespace by using "dotted module names".
A package can have one or more modules which means, a package is collection of modules and packages.
A package can contains packages.
Package is nothing but a Directory/Folder.
Package is nothing but a directory/folder which must contain a special file called __init__.py
__init__.py file can be empty, it indicates that the directory it contains is a python package, so it can be imported the same way a module can be imported.
