"""
1: tuple is a data_structure.
2: tuple can store any datatype.
3: tuples are immutable.
4: tuples are ordered collections of items.
5: you cannot change(add or delete) values from tuple once it created.
6: you can add, delete data from list which is present inside tuple.

#no append
#no insert
#no pop
#no remove

#use .count()
#use .index()
#use len()
#use slicing and indexing

when assign tuple: if you know your data will never change.

why assign tuple except list: tuples are faster.
