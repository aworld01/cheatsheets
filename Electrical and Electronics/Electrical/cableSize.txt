Earthing deep: 2.5m - 3m

Indian AC supply frequency 50Hz cycle per second

Amp = Watt / Volt:
    Watt = 1000W
    Volt = 200V
    5 = 1000 / 200

Watt = Volt * Amp:
    Volt = 200W
    Amp  = 5amp
    1000 = 200 * 5

1KW (Kilowatt) = 1000W (Watt)
1Amp (Ampare) = 1000mA (miliAmpare)
1HP = 746 Watts

Type of wiring
==============
    Conduit wiring:
        Surface wiring, concealed wiring
    Casing caping wiring
    Cleat Wiring

Type of current
===============
There are 2 types of current:
    1. AC (Alternating Current)
    2. DC (Direct Current)

Type of circuit
===============
    1. Open Circuit: The circuit is incomplete, stopping current flow
    2. Closed Circuit: The circuit is complete, allowing current to flow.
    3. Short Circuit: An unintended connection causes excessive current flow, often leading to damage.

Type of connection
==================
There are thee types of connection:
    1. Series Connection
    2. Parallel Connection
    3. Series-Parallel Connection
