TYPE OF DB
==========
MDB: Main Distribution Board
SDB: Sub Distribution Board
LDB: Lighting Distribution Board
PDB: Power Distribution Board
IDB: Industrial Distribution Board
CU: Consumer Unit


CONDUTE
=======
PVC
---
HMS (Heavy Mechanical Stress): for slape piping.
MMS (Medium Mechanical Stress): for slape piping.
LMS (Light Mechanical Stress): for wall piping.

CONDUTE SIZE
============
"20mm" for Lighting
"25mm" for Power and others

"PVC" for Concealed piping
"GI" for open piping

WIRE SIZE
=========
2.5mm for Lighting
4mm for power
6mm for Geyser, AC, Oven, Boiler, etc

BREAKER SIZE
============
"16A, 20A, 32A" for power
"6A-10A" for Lighting

REQUIRED THINGS FOR DB DRESSING
===============================
Load Schedule
Ferrules (R,Y,B,N,E,0-9)
Cable ties
Insulation tape
Wire Stripper & Pliers
Screw drivers
Cable lugs & Clamping tool

GI BACKBOX
==========
3x3: Lighting
3x6: Power


DB AND BOX FIXING
=================
DB fixing height: 1800mm from top
Power socket height: 450mm
Lighting switch board height: 1200mm

MCB: "Overloads" and "short circuits" protection.
RCCB: "Human" protection.
RCBO: "Overloads", "short circuits", and "Human" protection.

WHY WE USE "RING CIRCUITS"
==========================
1. Reducing the load on individual wires
2. Smaller dimeter wires can be used campared to radial circuits
3. If one section of the ring fails, power can still be supplied from the other direction.


Voltage in single phase: 220v-230v
Voltage in 3 phase: 415v-440v

ACB (Air circuits Breaker): use for MDB in substations
