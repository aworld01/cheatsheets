The "number codes" on lithium batteries can refer to several different things, depending on the type of battery and what information the manufacturer is conveying. Here's a breakdown of the common meanings.

1. Dimensions (especially for cylindrical and prismatic batteries):

    Cylindrical Batteries (e.g. 18650): The numbers often indicate the physical size:
        First two digits: Diameter in millimeters (e.g. "18" in 18650 means 18mm diameter)

	Next two digits: Length in millimeters (e.g. "65" in 18650 means 65mm length)

	Last digit (often "0"): indicates the cylindrical shape.

    Prismatic / Pouch Batteries (e.g. LP521540): These numbers usually represent the battery's dimensions in millimeters.
        Example: LP521540 could mean 5.2mm thickness, 15mm width, and 40mm length (sometimes the decimal point replacement varies, so always 	check the manufacturer's specific naming convention.


For battery pack:

    1S (Single cell): ~3.7V
    2S (Two cells in series): ~7.4V
    3S (Three cells in series): ~11.1V

Discharge Rate (C-rating):
    C: This refers to the discharge rate, which indicates how quickly a battery can be safely discharged without damage. It's a multiple of the battery's capacity. 

    Example: A 50C rating on a 5Ah (5000mAh) battery means it can safely deliver a continuous current of 50C*5A = 250 Amperes.
