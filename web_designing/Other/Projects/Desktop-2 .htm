<br>
<font color="#ff00ff" size="+1"> Historical Buildings tell 'history of the past'. Delhi is famous for historical buildings. Jantar-Mantar, Jama Masjid,
The Red Fort and Birla Mandir are worth seeing in Delhi.
   Last Sunday I went see the Red Fort. I hired a scooter and reached there. Ticket for entrance was bought. Then I went 
through Lahore Gate of Nakkarkhana. Two halls called Diwan-E-Khas arracted me inside the Red Fort.
   A few Gardens, Golden Mosque and Zanana were seen inside it.
   Prime Minister of India delivers message to the Nation on Independence day from the Red Fort.
   The Red Fort was built by Mughal Emperor named Shahjahan. It is made of red stones Its architecture is unlimitable.
 A museum is arranged in one of its buildings. Old arms, old pictures and old royal robes depict past history of India.

<font color="#ff00ff" size="+1"> India is my country. It is the fifth biggest country of the world. It has a noble past. Indian civilization and culture are the oldest
in the world. The vedas are the best and oldest books in the library of the world. Our policy has always been to live
and live. Our players have also won name in Hockey.
  India is rich in forest wealth. It has many kinds of birds and animals. It has small villages where real India lives.
It has big towns like Mumbai and colocatta. Delhi is the capital of our country.
  India is a republic now. We have our national Hag. It has three colours. The different colours stand for different virtues.
Our national language is Hindi. Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Lala Lajpat Rai, Subhash Chandra Bose and many others are 
the gems of India.
  It is a great country. It has always been a torch-bearer to the rest of the world. My country is a fit abode for the Gods.
