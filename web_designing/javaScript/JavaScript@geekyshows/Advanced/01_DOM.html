<h1>DOM (Document Object Model)</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a Application Programming Interface (API) for HTML and XML documents.
    </li>
    <li>
        With the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify or delete elements and content.
    </li>
    <li>
        The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
    </li>
    <li>
        The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree.
    </li>
    <li>
        According to Document Object Model (DOM), every HTML tag is an object, Nested tags are called "children" of the enclosing one. All operations on the DOM start with the document object. From it we can access any node.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Document Object Model can be used with any programming language.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>DOM Levels</h1>
<p>
    <b>DOM level 0:</b> This level supports the common document object collections - form[], image[], anchors[], links[] and applets[]. This is also known as classic or traditional JavaScript Object Model.<br><br> 

    <b>DOM level 1:</b> It provides the ability to manipulate all elements in a     document through a common set ot function. In this level all elements are   exposed and parts of the page can be read and written to at all times.<br><br> 

    <b>DOM level 2:</b> It provides further access to page elements primarily related to CSS and focuses on combining Level 0 and Level 1 while adding improved support for working with 
    XML documents.<br><br> 

    <b>DOM level 3:</b> Enhanced Level of Level 1 and Level 2 and added support for XPath and keyboard event handling.<br><br> 

    <b>DOM level 4:</b> Enhanced year 2015.
